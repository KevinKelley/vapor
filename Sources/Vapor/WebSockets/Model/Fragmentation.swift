    // MARK: Fragmentation

    The following rules apply to fragmentation:

    o  An unfragmented message consists of a single frame with the FIN
    bit set (Section 5.2) and an opcode other than 0.

    o  A fragmented message consists of a single frame with the FIN bit
    clear and an opcode other than 0, followed by zero or more frames
    with the FIN bit clear and the opcode set to 0, and terminated by
    a single frame with the FIN bit set and an opcode of 0.  A
    fragmented message is conceptually equivalent to a single larger
    message whose payload is equal to the concatenation of the
    payloads of the fragments in order; however, in the presence of
    extensions, this may not hold true as the extension defines the
    interpretation of the "Extension data" present.  For instance,
    "Extension data" may only be present at the beginning of the first
    fragment and apply to subsequent fragments, or there may be
    "Extension data" present in each of the fragments that applies
    only to that particular fragment.  In the absence of "Extension
    data", the following example demonstrates how fragmentation works.

    EXAMPLE: For a text message sent as three fragments, the first
    fragment would have an opcode of 0x1 and a FIN bit clear, the
    second fragment would have an opcode of 0x0 and a FIN bit clear,
    and the third fragment would have an opcode of 0x0 and a FIN bit
    that is set.

    o  Control frames (see Section 5.5) MAY be injected in the middle of
    a fragmented message.  Control frames themselves MUST NOT be
    fragmented.

    o  Message fragments MUST be delivered to the recipient in the order
    sent by the sender.

    o  The fragments of one message MUST NOT be interleaved between the
    fragments of another message unless an extension has been
    negotiated that can interpret the interleaving.

    o  An endpoint MUST be capable of handling control frames in the
    middle of a fragmented message.

    o  A sender MAY create fragments of any size for non-control
    messages.

    o  Clients and servers MUST support receiving both fragmented and
    unfragmented messages.

    o  As control frames cannot be fragmented, an intermediary MUST NOT
    attempt to change the fragmentation of a control frame.

    o  An intermediary MUST NOT change the fragmentation of a message if
    any reserved bit values are used and the meaning of these values
    is not known to the intermediary.

    o  An intermediary MUST NOT change the fragmentation of any message
    in the context of a connection where extensions have been
    negotiated and the intermediary is not aware of the semantics of
    the negotiated extensions.  Similarly, an intermediary that didn't
    see the WebSocket handshake (and wasn't notified about its
    content) that resulted in a WebSocket connection MUST NOT change
    the fragmentation of any message of such connection.

    o  As a consequence of these rules, all fragments of a message are of
    the same type, as set by the first fragment's opcode.  Since
    control frames cannot be fragmented, the type for all fragments in
    a message MUST be either text, binary, or one of the reserved
    opcodes.
